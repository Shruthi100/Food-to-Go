# Food-to-Go
Programming for Hotel management system targeted for Hotel 
integrates the billing management of the food ordered for timely 
response. This eliminates time delay for calculating the bill manually. 
Program initially contains list of food and its price in the menu. The 
program supports the user to change the price of the food and also 
add new item into the menu. Programmer has to initially check for 
the list of food and its price in the menu and accordingly enter the 
food number and the food quantity to generate the bill. 
This projectâ€™s main motto is to reduce the effort of bill calculating 
and to provide better service to the costumer on time. This program 
is untroublesome as it will serve the admin or the biller to be 
updated about the records without any strains.
